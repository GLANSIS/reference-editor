# GLANSIS Reference Editor

**Summary**:The GLANSIS Reference Cleaner script automates the process of cleaning and uploading journal article references. It guides users through exporting references from EndNote, cleaning the data, and adding keywords extracted from PDFs. The script checks for duplicates, standardizes DOI and URL fields, corrects title capitalization using a machine learning model, and adds HTML tags for scientific names. It also highlights missing values and ensures the proper structure of the reference data, making it ready for bulk upload. There is a script with the original markdown file and a script to use a widget/GUI for users less experienced using Python.
